## Description
This technique uses a data logger to take long- term measurements of the electrical energy (kWh) and power draw (kW) of a system or component at one- hour intervals. Measurements are taken at the electrical distribution system (more specifically at a panelboard , power panel or switchgear) that serves the system or component. Measurement data is used to estimate the annual energy consumption of the system or component. 

Data loggers and power meters use instantaneous measurements of current and voltage to calculate the instantaneous power draw. Over time, the logger or meter calculates the average power draw. Manufacturers of measurement equipment use different calculations for power draw. In order to compare data obtained from different measurement equipment it is important to understand the calculation used by the equipment. The manufacturer’s user manual or technical specifications discuss these features in detail. 

The duration of the long-term measurement and when to measure is dependent on the system and the operation of the building. The best practice is a minimum of six weeks and data should be collected at one-hour intervals; longer measurement periods are encouraged for deeper analysis of the equipment. Measurements should be taken when the system or component is operating under normal conditions. 

### Type of Measurement
Direct and Proxy 

Electrical energy measurements are direct measurements of energy, and the obtained data can be used to calculate the annual energy consumption of the system or component.

This methodology can also be used as a proxy measurement of operational hours of the system or component. Daily or weekly models can be developed to better characterize the equipment. 

### Equipment
The measurement equipment needed for this procedure is an energy data logger that has the capacity to measure AC voltage and current. Refer to the [FELL catalog] (https://nycenergytools.com/equipment/?_measurement_type=energy&_equipment_type=logger) to identify data loggers that measure power and energy draw by an electricity-powered system. The contents of this guide are largely based off of the [Dent EliteProXC] (https://nycenergytools.com/equipment/energy-logger-2/) power data logger, which can be found and borrowed through FELL. 

The sensors used to measure AC current are known as current transformers. This is because they operate like the transformers used by utility companies to step-up and step-down voltage. Alternating current in the conductor (the wire that is being measured) induces a voltage on the current transformer which then produces a current signal that the data logger detects and records. However, unlike utility transformers, the measurement equipment only transforms a tiny portion of the current flowing through the wire that is being measured. AC voltage is measured with voltage leads (usually alligator clips). 

Please note that loggers will require setup with a computer or phone using the manufacturer’s proprietary software prior to installation and measurement logging and that older loggers will require the use of a cable to connect to a computer. Refer to the measurement equipment’s user manual for a detailed description of setup requirements.
