## General System Overview

This guide describes the measurement approach for quantifying avoided 
energy use associated with retrofitting supply and return fans in air 
handling units (AHUs) with variable frequency drives (VFDs) and/or more efficient motors.

## Safety

This guide does not cover health and safety aspects of the collection of measurements at facilities. 
There are many hazards that exist in facilities surrounding the collection of measurements, 
including but not limited to: electrical safety, fall protection, personal protective equipment, 
control of hazardous energy (lock out/ tag out), confined space, respiratory protection, 
and machine safeguarding. Part of the measurement planning process must include the 
identification and mitigation of these and other hazards. The implementation of a 
measurement strategy and installation of measurement equipment should be performed by qualified personnel.

## Description of System

The following sections provide background information on the components of an AHU. 
If you are already familiar with the system, you may skip to the Measurement Description for System section.

## System Overview

An AHU provides conditioned air to the spaces it serves. This may include one or more of the following:

- Space heating
- Space cooling
- Ventilation
- Humidification
- Dehumidification
- Filtration
