## General Overview

An air-cooled chilled water plant consists of an air-cooled chiller system and a chilled water loop system operating to meet the cooling demand in a facility. The air-cooled chiller produces chilled water through the basic refrigeration cycle. The primary chilled water pump circulates the chilled water between the chiller and the chilled water loop. In some cases, a secondary chilled water pump distributes the chilled water produced by the chiller to air handling units (AHUs) in the building.

## Air-cooled Chilled Water Plant Systems and Components

### Air-cooled Chiller System

Figure 2 shows an air-cooled chiller providing chilled water to the chilled water loop system and components.

### Chilled Water Loop System

A chilled water loop system consists of a closed loop distribution system that supplies chilled water to the building and includes components (see Figure 3).

## Evaluation of Energy Consumption

The primary energy consumption of an air-cooled chilled water plant is the sum of the energy consumption of the components of each system. The thermal energy rejected from the building to the outdoors can also be measured to evaluate the overall performance of the plant, usually in kilowatts of power consumer per ton of cooling provided (kW/ton). Table 1  provides a summary of system component measurements and values needed to quantify the annual energy consumption and operating characteristics of an air-cooled chilled water plant.
