## General Overview

### Hot Water Heating Plant

The hot water heating (HWH) plant takes input energy (e.g., fuel, electricity, biomass) and generates hot water that is distributed throughout a facility to provide space heating. A HWH boiler may also generate hot water to provide for other loads, such as domestic hot water or process heat. A hot water heating plant consists of a hot water heating boiler, a feedwater system, and a hot water heating loop.

## Key Values Needed to Assess Energy Conumption

The total energy consumption of a HWH plant is the sum of the energy consumption of the components of each system. In a HWH plant this includes the fuel usage consumed by the boiler to satisfy the heating load and the electricity required by the burner fan motor, primary and secondary pumps and feedwater pump. Table 1 provides a summary of system component measurements and values needed to quantify the annual energy consumption and operating characteristics of the HWH plant.
