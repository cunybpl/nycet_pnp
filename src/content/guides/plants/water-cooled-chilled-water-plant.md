## General Overview

A water-cooled chilled water plant consists of a water-cooled chiller system, a condenser water loop system and a chilled water loop system operating together to meet cooling demand in a facility. If a waterside economizer is implemented in the facility, the chilled water plant includes a waterside economizer system as well.

## Systems

### Water-cooled Chiller

A water-cooled chiller produces chilled water using the basic refrigeration cycle, which is then distributed through the chilled water loop to the facility. The primary systems and components of a water-cooled chiller are shown in Figure 2.

### Chilled Water Loop

A chilled water loop consists of a closed loop distribution system that supplies chilled water to the building. Components of a chilled water loop are shown in Figure 3.

    </figure>
</a>

### Condenser Water Loop

A condenser water loop consists of an open loop distribution system that circulates condenser water from a chiller condenser to a cooling tower, where the condenser water is cooled and returned to the chiller condenser. Components of a condenser water loop are shown in Figure 4.

### Waterside Economizer System

Waterside economizers may use an external plate-and-frame heat exchanger between the condenser and chilled water loop, or the chiller itself may be set up to perform the function of a waterside heat exchanger. When the outdoor temperatures are favorable, heat from the chilled water loop may be rejected directly to the condenser water loop through a heat exchanger without running the chiller compressor motor. Components of a waterside economizer system are shown in Figure 5.

## Evaluation of Energy Consumption

The primary energy consumption of a water-cooled chilled water plant is the total energy used by its individual components. The thermal energy rejected from the building to the outdoors can also be measured to assess the plant’s overall performance, typically expressed in kilowatts of power consumed per ton of cooling provided (kW/ton). Table 1 summarizes the system component measurements and values needed to quantify the annual energy consumption and operating characteristics of the water-cooled chilled water plant.
