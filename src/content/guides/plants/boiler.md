## General System Overview

This guide describes the measurement approach for quantifying avoided energy 
use associated with retrofitting existing boiler systems with more efficient boilers.

## Safety

This guide does not cover health and safety aspects of the collection of measurements at facilities. 
There are many hazards that exist in facilities surrounding the collection of measurements, 
including but not limited to: electrical safety, fall protection, personal protective equipment, 
control of hazardous energy (lock out/tag out), confined space, respiratory protection, and machine safeguarding. 
Part of the measurement planning process must include the identification and mitigation of these and other hazards. 
The implementation of a measurement strategy and installation of measurement equipment should be performed by qualified personnel.

## Description of System

The following sections provide background information on the components of a boiler system. 
If you are already familiar with the system, you may skip to the Measurement Description for System section.

## System Overview

A boiler system is comprised of a closed pressure vessel, exhaust vents for flue gases, a motor for air intake, and a burner to initiate combustion. Two examples of commercial boilers are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
