## General System

This guide describes the measurement approach for quantifying avoided energy use 
associated with retrofitting an existing chiller with an air-cooled chiller.

## Safety

This guide does not cover health and safety aspects of the collection of measurements at facilities. 
There are many hazards that exist in facilities surrounding the collection of measurements, 
including but not limited to: electrical safety, fall protection, personal protective equipment, 
control of hazardous energy (lock out/ tag out), confined space, respiratory protection, and 
machine safeguarding. Part of the measurement planning process must include the identification and 
mitigation of these and other hazards. The implementation of a measurement strategy and installation of measurement equipment should be performed by qualified personnel.

## Description of System

The following sections provide background information on the components of air-cooled chillers. 
If you are already familiar with the system, you may skip to the Measurement Description for System section.

## System Overview

An air-cooled chiller provides chilled water to air handling units in a facility. The primary components of an air-cooled chiller are listed below and shown in Figure 1.

- The **evaporator** transfers heat from the chilled water to the refrigerant.
- The **compressor** increases the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant; a chiller may have one or more compressors.
- Refrigerant leaves the compressor and flows through the **condenser coils** to reject heat and lower the temperature of the refrigerant.
- **Condenser fans** cool down the refrigerant by forcing airflow over the condenser coils using outdoor air.
- The **expansion valve** reduces the pressure in the refrigerant, allowing it to collect heat in the evaporator.
