## Content B

This technique uses a data logger and current transformers to take long-term measurements of electrical current (Amps) at one-hour intervals. This data provides insight on the operating schedule of the system or component and can be used to calculate energy consumption of the target equipment at the power panel or electrical panelboard. A system or component that is running (i.e., consuming energy) will have high current draw. A system or component that is not running (i.e., has no energy consumption) will have low or no current draw.  

Data loggers and current sensors use instantaneous measurements of current over the course of an hour to calculate the average amperage. As such, current data should be recorded as hourly average values, not instantaneous. When taking one-hour measurements, the logger will detect current over the course of every hour and store that value. Sometimes current can fluctuate over a one-hour period (motors turn off or change speed) but the instantaneous current value will not indicate that change.  

The duration of the long-term measurement and when to measure is dependent on the system and the operation of the building. The best practice is a minimum of six weeks and data should be collected at one-hour intervals; longer measurement periods are encouraged for deeper analysis of the equipment. Measurements should be taken when the system or component is operating under normal conditions.
