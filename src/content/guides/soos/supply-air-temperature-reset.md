## Description of Supply Air Temperature Reset Sequence of Operation

On warmer days during the heating season, the supply air temperature to the zones from the AHU plant can be lowered (i.e., reset) to meet the more moderate heating demands. During cooling season, the temperature can be reset upwards during periods of moderate cooling demands.

The goal of Supply Air Temperature Reset (SATR) is to use less energy to meet heating and cooling demand. When Outdoor air temperature (OAT) is moderate, the rate of heating or cooling energy supplied to the zones is moderated. Besides increasing the efficiency of the heat transfer throughout the system, there is also a reduction in the likelihood of reheat calls at variable air volume (VAV) boxes during the cooling season. In addition, the SOO modulates temperature swings in the zones, thereby improving occupant comfort.


{{< admonition type="note" >}}
The NYC Energy Conservation Code (Section C403.6.5) requires supply air temperature reset for all multi-zone AHUs: Multiple-zone HVAC systems shall include controls that automatically reset the supply-air temperature in response to representative building loads, or to outdoor air temperature. The controls shall be configured to reset the supply air temperature not less than 25 percent of the difference between the design supply-air temperature and the design room air temperature.

According to ASHRAE 36-2018 (“High Performance Sequences of Operation for HVAC Systems”), single-zone air handling units (AHUs) should also have a SATR.
