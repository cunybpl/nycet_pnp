## General System Overview

This guide describes the measurement approach for quantifying energy savings associated with an air handling unit system retrofitted with a demand control ventilation (DCV) system. DCV is an energysaving strategy to maintain desired CO2 levels in a space based on occupancy. The types of AHUs addressed include:

1. Constant Air Volume (CAV) with fixed discharge air temperature and a fixed damper position.
2. Constant Air Volume (CAV) with fixed discharge air temperature and a variable OA damper position.
3. Variable Air Volume (VAV) with fixed discharge air temperature and variable OA damper position.

## Safety

This guide does not cover health and safety aspects of the collection of measurements at facilities. There are many hazards that exist in facilities surrounding the collection of measurements, including but not limited to: electrical safety, fall protection, personal protective equipment, control of hazardous energy (lock out/ tag out), confined space, respiratory protection, and machine safeguarding. Part of the measurement planning process must include the identification and mitigation of these and other hazards, and only qualified personnel should be used to support the implementation of a measurement strategy, as appropriate.

## Description of System

The following sections provide background information on the components of an AHU and DCV. If you are already familiar with the system, you may skip to the Measurement Description for System section.
