## General Overview

An air-cooled chiller consists of an evaporator, a compressor, condenser fans, and an expansion valve. The system produces chilled water through the basic refrigeration cycle.

## Components

Each of the various components associated with an air-cooled chiller are listed below (see Figure 1). Air-cooled chillers may be customized with a variety of high-performance components, such as variable frequency drives (VFD) on condenser fans and compressors, high efficiency compressor designs, thermostatic or electronic expansion valves, condenser coils with enhanced heat transfer characteristics, optimized condenser fan design and system airflow characteristics, and digital direct control systems that optimize the energy efficiency of the chiller.

### Evaporator

The evaporator transfers heat from the chilled water to the refrigerant.

### Compressor

The compressor increases the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant; a chiller may have one or more compressors. Air-cooled chillers typically have screw, scroll and reciprocating compressors. Reciprocating compressors are one of the most widely used types of compressors in this type of chillers. It comprises a cylinder and a piston that performs reciprocating motion to enable the compression of the refrigerant. Screw compressors can produce high pressure for small amounts of refrigerant vapor, compressing the refrigerant between a pair of meshing screws. Scroll compressors have two interleaved scrolls that simultaneously rotate to compress the refrigerant vapor in a chamber.

### Condenser Fan

Condenser fans of an air-cooled chiller cool down the refrigerant by forcing airflow over the condenser coils using outdoor air.

#### Constant-speed, Constant-volume Condenser Fan

A constant-speed, constant-volume (CSCV) fan uses a power-driven rotating impeller to circulate air at a single speed.

#### Variable-speed, Variable-volume Condenser Fan

A variable-speed, variable-volume (VSVV) fan uses a power-driven rotating impeller to circulate air. Air flow rates fluctuate as required by the plant and system it serves.

### Expansion Valve

The expansion valve reduces the pressure in the refrigerant, allowing it to collect heat in the evaporator.

## Evaluation of Energy Consumption

The primary energy consumption of an air-cooled chiller is the electricity used for the compressor motor and condenser fan motors. The thermal energy rejected by the chiller to the outdoors can also be measured to evaluate the overall performance of the chiller. These to values can be expressed as kilowatts of power consumed per ton of cooling provided (kW/ton). Table 1  provides a summary of the components measurements and values needed to quantify the annual energy consumption and operating characteristics of an air-cooled chiller.
